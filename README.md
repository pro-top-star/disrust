# Credits and final comments

Thanks to <b>Traumatism</b> (https://github.com/Traumatism) and their project <b>ToastCord</b> (https://github.com/Traumatism/ToastCord) for guidance. This would have been a lot more confusing to code without them.

Thanks to <b>6cord</b> (https://github.com/diamondburned/6cord) for the initial inspiration

I appreciate any and all roasting of the code so I can improve. 

Feel free to modify this code however you like (As long as the license remains GPL 3.0) or use for reference on how to interact with discord's API and specifically gateway, it was a pain in the ass to setup. I wish I had a reference like this in Rust when I started. 

The API in general is pretty neat btw. I recommend messing with it or maybe starting a project with it.
