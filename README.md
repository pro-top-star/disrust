# disrust
TUI discord client written in Rust.

The use of this app is very much not kosher according to discord's tos. I do not recommend using it. I made it mostly to get better at rust and because it's fun. Discord's API is pretty convenient, I like it. 

The app is not fully feature complete. It's missing a lot of discord features, but the basics like navigating between servers, viewing channels, sending messages, etc are there. I might eventually come back to clean up code and make it fancier.


Use arrows to navigate.

Press e to enter editing mode and esc to leave it

Press enter to open a server and view channels or send a message if you are in editing mode

Press q to quit the app


Feel free to use this code however you like (As long as the license remains GPL 3.0) for reference on how to interact with discord's API and specifically gateway, it was a pain in the ass to setup.

Finish over lunch
